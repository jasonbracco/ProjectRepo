    <h4><em>Quck History</em></h4>
        <p class="quickBio">
            My name is Jason Bracco and I am currently enrolled in the April 25th cohort for Web Development.
            I am originally from New York, but have lived in Washington, DC since 2015.  I graduated from The George Washington University in 2018
            with a degree in Mechanical Engineering.  I current work at a company named Aquicore, leading our Support Teams at a company that does ESG
            benchmarking for Commercial REal Estate Companies.

    <h4><em>Me now</em></h4>
        <p class ="quickBio">
            I love to watch and play sports, however I realized I needed a new hobby/passion once my body started to get a little older 
            (even though I'm only 26).  Web Development has always been something I was interested in, but was too scared to jump into it at a 
            younger age.  Now that I am more confident in my abilities, and can see the world from a different perspective, I realize how valuable 
            and practical this skill is.  I am so looking forward to applying these skills both professionally and personally.
        </p>
    <h4><em>My Family</em></h4>
        <p id="family">My mom is Bolivian and grew up in Bethesda, Maryland, and my dad grew iup in Long Island and West Virginia.  My mom went to the University
            of Marylnd for undergrad, and then got her MBA at Duke University.  My dad went to Ualbany for his undergrad, and then to Carnegie Mellon
            for his Graduate Degree.  I have one sister, who is two years younger than I am.  She went to Brown University for Economics, and then moved
            to Washington, DC in September 2020.
